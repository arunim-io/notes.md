# Points to consider when writing a summary
- It must be in a single paragraph.
- It must be short & concise.
- It must contain all the important points of the writing, including an additional sentence. For example, if an article has 5 paragraphs, then the summary must have 6 sentences.
- The concluding sentence must be similar to the concluding paragraph/sentence of the writing. There is no need to make up a concluding sentence.
- The summary must be written from the objective point of view of the writing.
- It must be written either in past or present tense. **DON'T** mix up tenses in your summary.
- The number of times of author tagging must correspond to the number of paragraphs of the writing. The author's name **MUST** be mentioned in the concluding sentence.
- Don't forget to make a reference section at the end of your summary.
